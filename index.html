	<p><font color="25383C">A cause for photos was originally suppose to be a website for my mother and I to share and sell our photograghy with others. Unfortunately my mother had been battling with cancer for about 8 years and recently lost her battle at the begining of 2016. Kim (my mother) was the one who came up with the idea of starting a website to sell our photography. She loved to snap photos but knew that I was struggling to make it on my own and was trying to come up with ideas to help me. We both spent quite a bit of time capturing beautiful pictures but never got around to creating a website. After she had passed away I had enrolled in an HTML course at school. The main object of the class was to have each student create their own website from scratch. I thought what a perfect idea it would be to create the website me and my mother had wanted and use it as a fundraiser for cancer research, or even to help those that are suffering with the horrible disease. So here is my site I hope you enjoy our photos and would l love any comments or advice you have to give me. 
        Thanks!
